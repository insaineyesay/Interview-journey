# Interview-journey
This is to pull together all of the resources and steps I used to prepare for my first FAANG Interview. The one thing I noticed however, is that everyone is so focused on the interview, and preparing for the interview, that we skip over learning just to become a better developer. Sure the end result is to be ready for an interview, but if you're just a regular dude like me, you just want to get gud. Make decent money, and chill. So that's how my guide is focused. If you don't like that, see the [Other Learning Resources](#other-learning-resources) Section for variances on this same knowledge and study path.

# Data Structures and Algorithms. 
I'm a relatively new Swift Developer so not only do I need practice in basic Swift development, but also I'm a Business Graduate, not a CS Grad, so I've taught myself everything. This is great, however it also means I've missed a ton of things along the way, just trying to get the job done. 

Of course you know by now, in order to truly be a Master Developer, you have to have a decent understanding of Computer Science behind your experience. Here are the readings and repo's I've utilized to make the journey a little easier. Mine will be Swift focused, but normally its all transferrable.

This is by far the best resource in Swift that I've seen for DS and Algos: 
- [Swift Algorithm Club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club) - This helped me tremendously, because not too many people are using swift in these interviews. 


# Using your network for guidance. 
I work at a fortune 30 medical insurance company. So, every now and then smart people get hired. Normally, they end up using this company as a springboard to something better. We've had guys go to Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. I think there's one guy in front of me that will make it to a large Silicon Valley organization, but after him, I'm on deck for take off, (Aug 2020 currently) so I need to get moving lol.

These guys that have moved onto other things are cool enough that they come back and help guide us through the path. This is incredibly vital. If you don't have such a group, create a slack channel or try to find one that you can get into. Normally, people love to help others and as long as you don't abuse the relationship, you should be able to ask general 'wtf' questions, to help you get over a hump. I wouldn't say problem specific questions, because that's exactly what you have to figure out on your own, but more like 'do you have a good resource for system design?' type of questions.
